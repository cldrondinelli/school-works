    <p>"Many's the night I dreamed of cheese-toased." Robert Louis Stevenson</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>

    <hr>

    <p>We make cheese. Lots of cheese; more than eight tons of cheese a year. Your Brie, your Gouda, your havari, we make it all!
    
        <h2>Why We Do It</h2>

    <p>We are paid an awful lot of money by people who like cheese. So we make more. Cheese is not jusy<br>
        for mice anymore, you know. These days <i>everybody</i> is getting into cheese. On sandwiches, salads,<br> 
         with meats or alone. It's the perfect complement to an appetite. So remember.</p>

    <h5>Say cheese!</h5>
