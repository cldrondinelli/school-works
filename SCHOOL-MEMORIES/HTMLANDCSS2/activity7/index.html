        For Your mercy never fails me 
        All my days, I've been held in Your hands <br>

        Until I lay my head <br>
        Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God 
        And all my life You have been faithful 
        And all my life You have been so, so good <br>
        With every breath that I am able 
        Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God <br>
        <br>
        I love Your voice <br>
        You have led me through the fire
        In the darkest night 
        You are close like no other <br>
        I've known You as a Father 
        I've known You as a Friend <br>
        And I have lived in the goodness of God (yeah)</i></p>
